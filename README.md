The repository contains all code related to our AVD module.  
  
As the project is multi-disciplinary, most of the wasted time will be because of lack of version control, files which aren't necessarily in the correct place etc.  
  
In order to minimise this wasted time, the plan is (subject to change) we have a single matlab script called 'main.mlx' in which all of our main calculations are made in this script.  

To enable people to work separately as well, it is best recommended for any custom calculations we want to make, that we write functions that we can then call in the 'main.mlx' file; please remember to add any custom functions into the repository
  
This main.mlx file is broken up into 'sections' from Week II and beyond.  
  
_**The 'sections' include:**_  
  
**Week II** - Wing  
**Week II** - Powerplant / Propulsion  
**Week III** - Fuselage Sizing  
**Week III** - Tailplane Sizing  
**Week III** - Aircraft Systems  
**Week IV** - Structural Layout Considerations  
**Week IV** - UC Sizing  
**Week IV** - Weight and Balance  
**Week IV** - Aerodynamic Performance  
**Week V** - Stabilty  
**Week V** - Performance  

_**Each section is broken down into:**_  

(a) 'The lecture notes' - very basic but very useful as references on things we need to think about for each section  
  
(b) 'Additional notes for reference (ie either from lecture or from discussion)' - any notes raised by other groups / by lectures that we should keep in mind  
  
(c) 'Calculations made with reference to this section' - these are the calculations we have made with reference to the section
